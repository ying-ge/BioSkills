Special thanks :
-----------------------------

I warmly thank Thomas A. Gerds for his very useful R package Refresh which I used a hundred times to re-build and/or check timeROC, and for having talked to me about Emacs Speaks Statistics (ESS) that is very convenient for R programming. 

I warmly thank Ulla Brasch Mogensen for her help to improve the help documentation.

I also thank Jean-Francois Dartigues, head of the PAQUID epidemiological study, for having provided the Paquid data.

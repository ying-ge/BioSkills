Package: nucleoSim
Version: 1.30.0
Date: 2015-07-24
Title: Generate synthetic nucleosome maps
Description: This package can generate a synthetic map with reads covering
    the nucleosome regions as well as a synthetic map with
    forward and reverse reads emulating next-generation sequencing.
    The synthetic hybridization data of “Tiling Arrays” can also be generated.
    The user has choice between three different
    distributions for the read positioning: Normal, Student and Uniform.
    In addition, a visualization tool is provided to explore the synthetic 
    nucleosome maps.

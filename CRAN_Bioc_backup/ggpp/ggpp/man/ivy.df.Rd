\title{Ivy photosynthesis light response}
\format{
A \code{data.frame} object with 36 rows and 6 variables.
}
\usage{
ivy.df
}
\description{
A dataset containing photosynthesis measurements on four ivy plants.
}
\details{
For each plant a light response curve of photosynthesis was measured
using a custom-built system and software that allowed controlling the
concentrations of water vapour and carbon dioxide at the surface of the
leaves, i.e., inside the air boundary layer.

\title{Nudge labels to new positions}
\usage{
position_nudge_to(
  x = NULL,
  y = NULL,
  x.action = c("none", "spread"),
  y.action = c("none", "spread"),
  x.distance = "equal",
  y.distance = "equal",
  x.expansion = 0,
  y.expansion = 0,
  kept.origin = c("original", "none")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x, y}{Coordinates of the destination position. A vector of mode
\code{numeric}, that is extended if needed, to the same length as rows
there are in \code{data}. The default, \code{NULL}, leaves the original
coordinates unchanged.}

\item{x.action, y.action}{character string, one of \code{"none"}, or
\code{"spread"}. With \code{"spread"} distributing the positions
within the range of argument \code{x} or \code{y}, if non-null. Otherwise,
using the range the variable mapped to \emph{x} or \code{y}.}

\item{x.distance, y.distance}{character or numeric Currently only
\code{"equal"} is implemented, indicating equal spacing between the
spread positions.}

\item{x.expansion, y.expansion}{numeric vectors of length 1 or 2, as a
fraction of width of the range used to spread positions.}

\item{kept.origin}{One of \code{"original"} or \code{"none"}.}
}
\value{
A \code{"Position"} object.
}
\description{
\code{position_nudge_to()} differs from \code{\link[ggplot2]{position_nudge}}
in that the coordinates of the new position are given directly, rather than
as a displacement from the original location. It optionally sets an even
spacing among positions within a range. As with other position functions in
this package, the original positions are preserved to allow the text or
labels to be linked back to their original position with a segment or arrow.
}
\details{
The nudged to
  \code{x} and/or \code{y} values replace the original ones in
  \code{data}, while the original coordinates are returned in
  \code{x_orig} and \code{y_orig}. Nudge values supported are those of
  \emph{mode} numeric, thus including dates and times when they match the
  mapped data.

  If the length of \code{x} and/or \code{y} is more than one but less than
  the rows present in the \code{data}, the vector is both recycled and
  reordered so that the nudges are applied sequentially based on the data
  values. If their length matches the number of rows in \code{data}, they are
  assumed to be already in \code{data} order.

  Irrespective of the action, the ordering of rows in \code{data} is
  preserved.
}
\note{
The current implementation DOES NOT support flipping geoms with the
\code{orientation} argument or implicitly by the mapping. It DOES NOT
apply scale transformations when spreading the positions.

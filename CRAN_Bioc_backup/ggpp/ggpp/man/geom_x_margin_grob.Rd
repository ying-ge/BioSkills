\usage{
geom_x_margin_grob(
  mapping = NULL,
  data = NULL,
  stat = "identity",
  position = "identity",
  ...,
  xintercept,
  sides = "b",
  grob.shift = 0,
  na.rm = FALSE,
  show.legend = FALSE,
  inherit.aes = FALSE
)

geom_y_margin_grob(
  mapping = NULL,
  data = NULL,
  stat = "identity",
  position = "identity",
  ...,
  yintercept,
  sides = "l",
  grob.shift = 0,
  na.rm = FALSE,
  show.legend = FALSE,
  inherit.aes = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mapping}{The aesthetic mapping, usually constructed with
\code{\link[ggplot2]{aes}}. Only needs to be set at the layer level if you
are overriding the plot defaults.}

\item{data}{A layer specific dataset - only needed if you want to override
the plot defaults.}

\item{stat}{The statistical transformation to use on the data for this layer,
as a string.}

\item{position}{Position adjustment, either as a string, or the result of a
call to a position adjustment function.}

\item{...}{other arguments passed on to \code{\link[ggplot2]{layer}}. This
can include aesthetics whose values you want to set, not map. See
\code{\link[ggplot2]{layer}} for more details.}

\item{xintercept, yintercept}{numeric Parameters that control the position of
the marginal points. If these are set, data, mapping and show.legend are
overridden.}

\item{sides}{A character string of length one that controls on which side of
the plot the grob annotations appear on. It can be set to a string
containing one of \code{"t"}, \code{"r"}, \code{"b"} or \code{"l"}, for
top, right, bottom, and left.}

\item{grob.shift}{numeric value expressed in npc units for the shift of the
marginal grob inwards from the edge of the plotting area.}

\item{na.rm}{If \code{FALSE} (the default), removes missing values with a
warning.  If \code{TRUE} silently removes missing values.}

\item{show.legend}{logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?
\code{NA}, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped. \code{FALSE}
never includes, and \code{TRUE} always includes.}

\item{inherit.aes}{If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics, rather
than combining with them. This is most useful for helper functions that
define both data and aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behaviour from the
default plot specification, e.g. \code{\link[ggplot2]{borders}}.}

\value{
A plot layer instance.

\description{
Margin grobs can supplement a 2d display with annotations. Margin grobs such
as icons or symbols can highlight individual values along a margin. The
geometries \code{geom_x_margin_grob()} and \code{geom_y_margin_grob()} behave
similarly \code{geom_vline()} and \code{geom_hline()} and share their "double
personality" as both annotations and geometries.
}
\section{Alignment}{
 You can modify text alignment with the \code{vjust} and
  \code{hjust} aesthetics. These can either be a number between 0
  (right/bottom) and 1 (top/left) or a character (\code{"left"},
  \code{"middle"}, \code{"right"}, \code{"bottom"}, \code{"center"},
  \code{"top"}). In addition, you can use special alignments for
  justification including \code{"position"}, \code{"inward"} and
  \code{"outward"}. Inward always aligns text towards the center of the
  plotting area, and outward aligns it away from the center of the plotting
  area. If tagged with \code{_mean} or \code{_median} (e.g.,
  \code{"outward_mean"}) the mean or median of the data in the panel along
  the corresponding axis is used as center. If the characters following the
  underscore represent a number (e.g., \code{"outward_10.5"}) the reference
  point will be this value in data units. Position justification is computed
  based on the direction of the displacement of the position of the label so
  that each individual text or label is justified outwards from its original
  position. The default justification is \code{"position"}.

  If no position displacement is applied, or a position function defined in
  'ggplot2' is used, these geometries behave similarly to the corresponding
  ones from package 'ggplot2' with a default justification of \code{0.5} and
  no segment drawn.
}

\section{Position functions}{
 Many layer functions from package 'ggpp' are
  designed to work seamlessly with position functions that keep, rather than
  discard, the original \code{x} and \code{y} positions in \code{data} when
  computing a new displaced position. See \code{\link{position_nudge_keep}},
  \code{\link{position_dodge_keep}}, \code{\link{position_jitter_keep}},
  \code{\link{position_nudge_center}}, \code{\link{position_nudge_line}},
  \code{\link{position_nudge_to}}, \code{\link{position_dodgenudge}},
  \code{\link{position_jitternudge}}, and \code{\link{position_stacknudge}}
  for examples and details of their use.

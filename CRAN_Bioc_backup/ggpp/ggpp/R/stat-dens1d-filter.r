#' @title Filter observations by local 1D density
#'
#' @description \code{stat_dens1d_filter} Filters-out/filters-in observations in
#'   regions of a plot panel with high density of observations, based on the
#'   values mapped to one of \code{x} and \code{y} aesthetics.
#'   \code{stat_dens1d_filter_g} does the same filtering by group instead of by
#'   panel. This second stat is useful for highlighting observations, while the
#'   first one tends to be most useful when the aim is to prevent clashes among
#'   text labels. By default the data are handled all together, but it is also
#'   possible to control labeling separately in each tail.
#'
#' @details The 1D density of observations of \emph{x} or \emph{y} is computed
#'   with function \code{\link[stats]{density}} and used to select observations,
#'   passing to the geom a subset of the rows in its \code{data} input. The
#'   default is to select observations in sparse regions of the plot, but the
#'   selection can be inverted so that only observations in the densest regions
#'   are returned. Specific observations can be protected from being deselected
#'   and "kept" by passing a suitable argument to \code{keep.these}. Logical and
#'   integer vectors work as indexes to rows in \code{data}, while a values in a
#'   character vector are compared to the character values mapped to the
#'   \code{label} aesthetic. A function passed as argument to keep.these will
#'   receive as argument the values in the variable mapped to \code{label} and
#'   should return a character, logical or numeric vector as described above. If
#'   no variable has been mapped to \code{label}, row names are used in its
#'   place.
#'
#'   How many rows are retained in addition to those in \code{keep.these} is
#'   controlled with arguments passed to \code{keep.number} and
#'   \code{keep.fraction}. \code{keep.number} sets the maximum number of
#'   observations selected, whenever \code{keep.fraction} results in fewer
#'   observations selected, it is obeyed. If `xintercept` is a finite value
#'   within the \emph{x} range of the data and \code{pool.along}
#'   is passed \code{"none"} the data as are split into two groups
#'   and \code{keep.number} and \code{keep.fraction} are applied separately to
#'   each tail with density still computed jointly from all observations. If the
#'   length of \code{keep.number} and \code{keep.fraction} is one, this value
#'   is used for both tails, if their length is two, the first value is use
#'   for the left tail and the second value for the right tail.
#'
#'   Computation of density and of the default bandwidth require at least
#'   two observations with different values. If data do not fulfill this
#'   condition, they are kept only if \code{keep.fraction = 1}. This is correct
#'   behavior for a single observation, but can be surprising in the case of
#'   multiple observations.
#'
#'   Parameters \code{keep.these} and \code{exclude.these} make it possible to
#'   force inclusion or exclusion of observations after the density is computed.
#'   In case of conflict, \code{exclude.these} overrides \code{keep.these}.
#'
#' @note Which points are kept and which not depends on how dense and flexible
#'   is the density curve estimate. This depends on the values passed as
#'   arguments to parameters \code{n}, \code{bw} and \code{kernel}. It is
#'   also important to be aware that both \code{geom_text()} and
#'   \code{geom_text_repel()} can avoid over plotting by discarding labels at
#'   the plot rendering stage, i.e., what is plotted may differ from what is
#'   returned by this statistic.
#'
#' @param mapping The aesthetic mapping, usually constructed with
#'   \code{\link[ggplot2]{aes}} or \code{\link[ggplot2]{aes_}}. Only needs to be
#'   set at the layer level if you are overriding the plot defaults.
#' @param data A layer specific dataset - only needed if you want to override
#'   the plot defaults.
#' @param geom The geometric object to use display the data.
#' @param keep.fraction numeric vector of length 1 or 2 [0..1]. The fraction of
#'   the observations (or rows) in \code{data} to be retained.
#' @param keep.number integer vector of length 1 or 2. Set the maximum number of
#'   observations to retain, effective only if obeying \code{keep.fraction}
#'   would result in a larger number.
#' @param keep.sparse logical If \code{TRUE}, the default, observations from the
#'   more sparse regions are retained, if \code{FALSE} those from the densest
#'   regions.
#' @param keep.these,exclude.these character vector, integer vector, logical
#'   vector or function that takes one or more variables in data selected by
#'   \code{these.target}. Negative integers behave as in R's extraction methods.
#'   The rows from \code{data} indicated by \code{keep.these} and
#'   \code{exclude.these} are kept or excluded irrespective of the local
#'   density.
#' @param these.target character, numeric or logical selecting one or more
#'   column(s) of \code{data}. If \code{TRUE} the whole \code{data} object is
#'   passed.
#' @param pool.along character, one of \code{"none"} or \code{"x"},
#'   indicating if selection should be done pooling the observations along the
#'   \emph{x} aesthetic, or separately on either side of \code{xintercept}.
#' @param xintercept numeric The split point for the data filtering. If
#'   \code{NA} the data are not split.
#' @param invert.selection logical If \code{TRUE}, the complement of the
#'   selected rows are returned.
#' @param bw numeric or character The smoothing bandwidth to be used. If
#'   numeric, the standard deviation of the smoothing kernel. If character, a
#'   rule to choose the bandwidth, as listed in \code{\link[stats]{bw.nrd}}.
#' @param adjust numeric A multiplicative bandwidth adjustment. This makes it
#'   possible to adjust the bandwidth while still using the a bandwidth
#'   estimator through an argument passed to \code{bw}. The larger the value
#'   passed to \code{adjust} the stronger the smoothing, hence decreasing
#'   sensitivity to local changes in density.
#' @param kernel character See \code{\link{density}} for details.
#' @param n numeric Number of equally spaced points at which the density is to
#'   be estimated for applying the cut point. See \code{\link{density}} for
#'   details.
#' @param return.density logical vector of lenght 1. If \code{TRUE} add columns
#'   \code{"density"} and \code{"keep.obs"} to the returned data frame.
#' @param orientation	character The aesthetic along which density is computed.
#'   Given explicitly by setting orientation to either \code{"x"} or \code{"y"}.
#' @param position The position adjustment to use for overlapping points on this
#'   layer
#' @param show.legend logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?
#'   \code{NA}, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped. \code{FALSE}
#'   never includes, and \code{TRUE} always includes.
#' @param inherit.aes If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics, rather
#'   than combining with them. This is most useful for helper functions that
#'   define both data and aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behaviour from the
#'   default plot specification, e.g. \code{\link[ggplot2]{borders}}.
#' @param ... other arguments passed on to \code{\link[ggplot2]{layer}}. This
#'   can include aesthetics whose values you want to set, not map. See
#'   \code{\link[ggplot2]{layer}} for more details.
#' @param na.rm	a logical value indicating whether \code{NA} values should be
#'   stripped before the computation proceeds.
#'
#' @return A plot layer instance. Using as output \code{data} a subset of the
#'   rows in input \code{data} retained based on a 1D filtering criterion.

Description: Pathifier is an algorithm that infers pathway deregulation
        scores for each tumor sample on the basis of expression data.
        This score is determined, in a context-specific manner, for
        every particular dataset and type of cancer that is being
        investigated. The algorithm transforms gene-level information
        into pathway-level information, generating a compact and
        biologically relevant representation of each sample.

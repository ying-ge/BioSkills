\title{Solve the Expected Dose of Drug to Achieve Given Effect from L.4 Model}
\usage{
.SolveExpDoesL4(y, drug_par)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{The expected effect (\% inhibition) of the drug to cell line}

\item{drug_par}{The parameters ("b_Hill", "c_Emin", "d_Emax", "e_log(EC50)")
for fitted dose-response model.}
}
\value{
A numeric value. It indicates the expected dose of drug.
}
\description{
This function will solve the fitted four-parameter logistic dose-response 
model and output the dose of drug at which it could achieve the \% inhibition
to cell growth.

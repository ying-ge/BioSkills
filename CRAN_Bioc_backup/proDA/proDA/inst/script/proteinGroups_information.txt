The proteinGroups.txt file in the inst/extdata folder was generated by MaxQuant. It contains information on a BioID experiment in Drosophila melanogaster. Label-free mass spectrometry was used to identify the interaction partners of 11 different palmitoyltransferases (short DHHC). The conditions are named after the tagged DHHC and the negative control condition 
is called S2R for the cell line. Each condition was measured in triplicates,
which means that there are a total of 36 conditions.

The original data (not yet published) was subset to the first 122 rows using the head command in UNIX.

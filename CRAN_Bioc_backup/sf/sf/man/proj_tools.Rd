\arguments{
\item{paths}{the search path to be set; omit if paths need to be queried}

\item{with_proj}{logical; if \code{NA} set for both GDAL and PROJ, otherwise set either for PROJ (\code{TRUE}) or GDAL (\code{FALSE})}

\item{enable}{logical; set this to enable (\code{TRUE}) or disable (\code{FALSE}) the proj network search facility}

\item{url}{character; use this to specify and override the default proj network CDN}

\item{source_crs, target_crs}{object of class \code{crs} or character}

\item{authority}{character; constrain output pipelines to those of authority}

\item{AOI}{length four numeric; desired area of interest for the resulting
coordinate transformations (west, south, east, north, in degrees).
For an area of interest crossing the anti-meridian, west will be greater than east.}

\item{Use}{one of "NONE", "BOTH", "INTERSECTION", "SMALLEST", indicating how AOI's
of source_crs and target_crs are being used}

\item{grid_availability}{character; one of "USED" (Grid availability is only used for sorting
results. Operations where some grids are missing will be sorted last), "DISCARD"
(Completely discard an operation if a required grid is missing)
, "IGNORED" (Ignore grid availability at all. Results will be presented as if all grids were
available.), or "AVAILABLE" (Results will be presented as if grids known to PROJ (that is
registered in the grid_alternatives table of its database) were available. Used typically when
networking is enabled.)}

\item{desired_accuracy}{numeric; only return pipelines with at least this accuracy}

\item{strict_containment}{logical; default \code{FALSE}; permit partial matching of the area
of interest; if \code{TRUE} strictly contain the area of interest.
The area of interest is either as given in AOI, or as implied by the
source/target coordinate reference systems}

\item{axis_order_authority_compliant}{logical; if \code{FALSE} always
choose ‘x’ or longitude for the first
axis; if TRUE, follow the axis orders given by the coordinate reference systems when
constructing the for the first axis; if \code{FALSE}, follow the axis orders given by}
}
\value{
\code{sf_proj_search_paths()} returns the search path (possibly after setting it)

\code{sf_proj_network} when called without arguments returns a logical indicating whether
network search of datum grids is enabled, when called with arguments it returns a character
vector with the URL of the CDN used (or specified with \code{url}).

\code{sf_proj_pipelines()} returns a table with candidate coordinate transformation
pipelines along with their accuracy; \code{NA} accuracy indicates ballpark accuracy.

Description: This package provides a novel feature selection algorithm for binary 
             classification using support vector machine recursive feature elimination 
             SVM-RFE and t-statistic. In this feature selection process, the selected 
             features are differentially significant between the two classes and also 
             they are good classifier with higher degree of classification accuracy.

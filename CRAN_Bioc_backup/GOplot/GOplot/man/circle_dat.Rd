\title{Creates a plotting object.}
\usage{
circle_dat(terms, genes)
}
\arguments{
\item{terms}{A data frame with columns for 'category', 'ID', 'term', adjusted
p-value ('adj_pval') and 'genes'}

\item{genes}{A data frame with columns for 'ID', 'logFC'}
}
\description{
The function takes the results from a functional analysis (for 
  example DAVID) and combines it with a list of selected genes and their 
  logFC. The resulting data frame can be used as an input for various ploting
  functions.
}
\details{
Since most of the gene- annotation enrichment analysis are based on 
  the gene ontology database the package was build with this structure in 
  mind, but is not restricted to it. Gene ontology is structured as an 
  acyclic graph and it provides terms covering different areas. These terms 
  are grouped into three independent \code{categories}: BP (biological 
  process), CC (cellular component) or MF (molecular function).
  
  The "ID" and "term" columns of the \code{terms} data frame refer to the ID 
  and term description, whereas the ID is optional.
  
  The "ID" column of the \code{genes} data frame can contain any unique 
  identifier. Nevertheless, the identifier has to be the same as in "genes" 
  from \code{terms}.

# GOplot

Despite the plethora of methods available for the functional analysis of omics data, obtaining comprehensive- yet detailed understanding of the results remains challenging. GOplot takes the output of any general enrichment analysis and generates plots at different levels of detail: from a general overview to identify the most enriched categories (bar plot, bubble plot) to a more detailed view displaying different types of information for molecules in a given set of categories (circle plot, chord plot, cluster plot). The package provides a deeper insight into omics data and allows scientists to generate insightful plots with only a few lines of code to easily communicate the findings.

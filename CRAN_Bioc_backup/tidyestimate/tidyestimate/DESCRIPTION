Description: The 'ESTIMATE' package infers tumor purity from expression data as a 
  function of immune and stromal infiltrate, but requires writing of intermediate 
  files, is un-pipeable, and performs poorly when presented with modern datasets 
  with current gene symbols. 'tidyestimate' a fast, tidy, modern reimagination of
  'ESTIMATE' (2013) <doi:10.1038/ncomms3612>.

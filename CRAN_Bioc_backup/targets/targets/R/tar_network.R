#' @description Analyze the pipeline defined in the target script file
#'   (default: `_targets.R`)
#'   and return the vertices and edges of the directed acyclic graph
#'   of dependency relationships.
#' @section Dependency graph:
#'   The dependency graph of a pipeline is a directed acyclic graph (DAG)
#'   where each node indicates a target or global object and each directed
#'   edge indicates where a downstream node depends on an upstream node.
#'   The DAG is not always a tree, but it never contains a cycle because
#'   no target is allowed to directly or indirectly depend on itself.
#'   The dependency graph should show a natural progression of work from
#'   left to right. `targets` uses static code analysis to create the graph,
#'   so the order of `tar_target()` calls in the `_targets.R` file
#'   does not matter. However, targets does not support self-referential
#'   loops or other cycles. For more information on the dependency graph,
#'   please read
#'   <https://books.ropensci.org/targets/targets.html#dependencies>.
#' @return A list with two data frames: `vertices` and `edges`. The
#'   vertices data frame has one row per target and columns with the
#'   the type of the target or object (stem, branch, map, cross, function,
#'   or object), each target's description, and each target's status
#'   (up to date, outdated, dispatched, completed, canceled, or errored),
#'   as well as metadata if available (seconds of runtime, bytes of
#'   storage, and number of dynamic branches).
#'   The edges data frame has one row for every edge and columns `to` and
#'   `from` to mark the starting and terminating vertices.
#' @inheritParams tar_outdated
#' @param targets_only Logical, whether to restrict the output to just targets
#'   (`FALSE`) or to also include imported global functions and objects.
#' @param names Names of targets. The graph visualization will operate
#'   only on these targets (and unless `shortcut` is `TRUE`,
#'   all the targets upstream as well). Selecting a small subgraph
#'   using `names` could speed up the load time of the visualization.
#'   Unlike `allow`, `names` is invoked before the graph is generated.
#'   Set to NULL to check/run all the targets (default).
#'   Otherwise, the object supplied to `names` should be a
#'   `tidyselect` expression like [any_of()] or [starts_with()]
#'   from `tidyselect` itself, or [tar_described_as()] to select target names
#'   based on their descriptions.
#' @param allow Optional, define the set of allowable vertices in the graph.
#'   Unlike `names`, `allow` is invoked only after the graph is mostly
#'   resolved, so it will not speed up execution.
#'   Set to `NULL` to allow all vertices in the pipeline and environment
#'   (default). Otherwise, you can supply symbols or
#'   `tidyselect` helpers like [starts_with()].
#' @param exclude Optional, define the set of exclude vertices from the graph.
#'   Unlike `names`, `exclude` is invoked only after the graph is mostly
#'   resolved, so it will not speed up execution.
#'   Set to `NULL` to exclude no vertices.
#'   Otherwise, you can supply symbols or `tidyselect`
#'   helpers like [any_of()] and [starts_with()].
#' @param outdated Logical, whether to show colors to distinguish outdated
#'   targets from up-to-date targets. (Global functions and objects
#'   still show these colors.) Looking for outdated targets
#'   takes a lot of time for large pipelines with lots of branches,
#'   and setting `outdated` to `FALSE` is a nice way to speed up the graph
#'   if you only want to see dependency relationships and pipeline progress.

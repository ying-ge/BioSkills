\title{Mixed-effects meta-analysis of binary outcomes using the DerSimonian and Laird method
}

\description{
Computes individual study odds or risk ratios for binary outcome data. Computes the summary odds or risk ratio using the DerSimonian and Laird method. Performs a test of heterogeneity among trials. Performs a test for the overall difference between groups (that is, after pooling the studies, do treated groups differ significantly from controls?).
}

\usage{
epi.dsl(ev.trt, n.trt, ev.ctrl, n.ctrl, names, method = "odds.ratio", 
   alternative = c("two.sided", "less", "greater"), conf.level = 0.95)
}

\arguments{
  \item{ev.trt}{observed number of events in the treatment group.}
  \item{n.trt}{number in the treatment group.}
  \item{ev.ctrl}{observed number of events in the control group.}
  \item{n.ctrl}{number in the control group.}
  \item{names}{character string identifying each trial.}
  \item{method}{a character string indicating the method to be used. Options are \code{odds.ratio} or \code{risk.ratio}.}
  \item{alternative}{a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis, must be one of \code{two.sided}, \code{greater} or \code{less}. }
  \item{conf.level}{magnitude of the returned confidence interval. Must be a single number between 0 and 1.}
}

\details{
\code{alternative = "greater"} tests the hypothesis that the DerSimonian and Laird summary measure of association is greater than 1. 
}

\value{
A list containing the following:
  \item{OR}{the odds ratio for each trial and the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval of the odds ratio for each trial.}
  \item{RR}{the risk ratio for each trial and the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval of the risk ratio for each trial.}
  \item{OR.summary}{the DerSimonian and Laird summary odds ratio and the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval of the DerSimonian and Laird summary odds ratio.}
  \item{RR.summary}{the DerSimonian and Laird summary risk ratio and the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval of the DerSimonian and Laird summary risk ratio.}
  \item{weights}{the inverse variance and DerSimonian and Laird weights for each trial.}
  \item{heterogeneity}{a vector containing \code{Q} the heterogeneity test statistic, \code{df} the degrees of freedom and its associated P-value.}
  \item{Hsq}{the relative excess of the  heterogeneity test statistic \code{Q} over the degrees of freedom \code{df}.}
  \item{Isq}{the percentage of total variation in study estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance.} 
  \item{tau.sq}{the variance of the treatment effect among trials.}
  \item{effect}{a vector containing \code{z} the test statistic for overall treatment effect and its associated P-value.}

\note{
Under the random-effects model, the assumption of a common treatment effect is relaxed, and the effect sizes are assumed to have a normal distribution with variance \code{tau.sq}.

Using this method, the DerSimonian and Laird weights are used to compute the pooled odds ratio.

The function checks each strata for cells with zero frequencies. If a zero frequency is found in any cell, 0.5 is added to all cells within the strata.

    This package makes it easy to use system TrueType fonts and with PDF or
    PostScript output files, and with bitmap output files in Windows. extrafont
    can also be used with fonts packaged specifically to be used with, such as
    the fontcm package, which has Computer Modern PostScript fonts with math
    symbols.

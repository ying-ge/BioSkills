Description: We innovatively defined a pathway mutation accumulate perturbation score (PMAPscore) to reflect the position and the cumulative effect of the genetic mutations at the pathway level. Based on the PMAPscore of pathways, identified prognosis-related pathways altered by somatic mutation and predict immunotherapy efficacy by constructing a multiple-pathway-based risk model (Tarca, Adi Laurentiu et al (2008) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btn577>).

	Hierarchical clustering of samples identified 2 groups that reflected

	interleukin 8 (IL-8), that was highly expressed in refractory T-ALL

	cells from patients who achieved complete remission. We next identified
	19 genes that were differentially expressed in T-ALL cells from patients
	who either had a relapse or remained in continuous complete remission.
	A model based on the expression of 3 of these genes was predictive
	of duration of remission. The 3-gene model was validated on a further
	set of T-ALL samples from 18 additional patients treated on the same

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: With the exponential growth of expression and protein-protein
	interaction (PPI) data, the frontier of research in systems biology
	shifts more and more to the integrated analysis of these large datasets.
	Of particular interest is the identification of functional modules
	in PPI networks, sharing common cellular function beyond the scope
	of classical pathways, by means of detecting differentially expressed
	regions in PPI networks. This requires on the one hand an adequate
	scoring of the nodes in the network to be identified and on the other
	hand the availability of an effective algorithm to find the maximally
	scoring network regions. Various heuristic approaches have been proposed
	in the literature. RESULTS: Here we present the first exact solution
	for this problem, which is based on integer-linear programming and
	its connection to the well-known prize-collecting Steiner tree problem
	from Operations Research. Despite the NP-hardness of the underlying
	combinatorial problem, our method typically computes provably optimal
	subnetworks in large PPI networks in a few minutes. An essential
	ingredient of our approach is a scoring function defined on network
	nodes. We propose a new additive score with two desirable properties:
	(i) it is scalable by a statistically interpretable parameter and
	(ii) it allows a smooth integration of data from various sources.
	We apply our method to a well-established lymphoma microarray dataset
	in combination with associated survival data and the large interaction
	network of HPRD to identify functional modules by computing optimal-scoring
	subnetworks. In particular, we find a functional interaction module
	associated with proliferation over-expressed in the aggressive ABC
	subtype as well as modules derived from non-malignant by-stander
	cells. AVAILABILITY: Our software is available freely for non-commercial

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: In model organisms such as yeast, large databases of protein-protein
	and protein-DNA interactions have become an extremely important resource
	for the study of protein function, evolution, and gene regulatory
	dynamics. In this paper we demonstrate that by integrating these
	interactions with widely-available mRNA expression data, it is possible
	to generate concrete hypotheses for the underlying mechanisms governing
	the observed changes in gene expression. To perform this integration
	systematically and at large scale, we introduce an approach for screening
	a molecular interaction network to identify active subnetworks, i.e.,
	connected regions of the network that show significant changes in
	expression over particular subsets of conditions. The method we present
	here combines a rigorous statistical measure for scoring subnetworks
	with a search algorithm for identifying subnetworks with high score.
	RESULTS: We evaluated our procedure on a small network of 332 genes
	and 362 interactions and a large network of 4160 genes containing
	all 7462 protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions in the yeast
	public databases. In the case of the small network, we identified
	five significant subnetworks that covered 41 out of 77 (53\%) of
	all significant changes in expression. Both network analyses returned
	several top-scoring subnetworks with good correspondence to known
	regulatory mechanisms in the literature. These results demonstrate
	how large-scale genomic approaches may be used to uncover signalling
	and regulatory pathways in a systematic, integrative fashion.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The survival of patients with diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma
	after chemotherapy is influenced by molecular features of the tumors.
	We used the gene-expression profiles of these lymphomas to develop
	a molecular predictor of survival. METHODS: Biopsy samples of diffuse
	large-B-cell lymphoma from 240 patients were examined for gene expression
	with the use of DNA microarrays and analyzed for genomic abnormalities.
	Subgroups with distinctive gene-expression profiles were defined
	on the basis of hierarchical clustering. A molecular predictor of
	risk was constructed with the use of genes with expression patterns
	that were associated with survival in a preliminary group of 160
	patients and was then tested in a validation group of 80 patients.
	The accuracy of this predictor was compared with that of the international
	prognostic index. RESULTS: Three gene-expression subgroups--germinal-center
	B-cell-like, activated B-cell-like, and type 3 diffuse large-B-cell
	lymphoma--were identified. Two common oncogenic events in diffuse
	large-B-cell lymphoma, bcl-2 translocation and c-rel amplification,
	were detected only in the germinal-center B-cell-like subgroup. Patients
	in this subgroup had the highest five-year survival rate. To identify
	other molecular determinants of outcome, we searched for individual
	genes with expression patterns that correlated with survival in the
	preliminary group of patients. Most of these genes fell within four
	gene-expression signatures characteristic of germinal-center B cells,
	proliferating cells, reactive stromal and immune cells in the lymph
	node, or major-histocompatibility-complex class II complex. We used
	17 genes to construct a predictor of overall survival after chemotherapy.
	This gene-based predictor and the international prognostic index
	were independent prognostic indicators. CONCLUSIONS: DNA microarrays
	can be used to formulate a molecular predictor of survival after
	chemotherapy for diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma.},

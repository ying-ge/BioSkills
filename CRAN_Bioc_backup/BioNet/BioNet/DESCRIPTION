Description: This package provides functions for the integrated
        analysis of protein-protein interaction networks and the
        detection of functional modules. Different datasets can be
        integrated into the network by assigning p-values of
        statistical tests to the nodes of the network. E.g. p-values
        obtained from the differential expression of the genes from an
        Affymetrix array are assigned to the nodes of the network. By
        fitting a beta-uniform mixture model and calculating scores
        from the p-values, overall scores of network regions can be
        calculated and an integer linear programming algorithm
        identifies the maximum scoring subnetwork.

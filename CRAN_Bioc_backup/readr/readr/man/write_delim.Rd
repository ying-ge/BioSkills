\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame or tibble to write to disk.}

\item{file}{File or connection to write to.}

\item{delim}{Delimiter used to separate values. Defaults to \code{" "} for \code{write_delim()}, \code{","} for \code{write_excel_csv()} and
\code{";"} for \code{write_excel_csv2()}. Must be a single character.}

\item{na}{String used for missing values. Defaults to NA. Missing values
will never be quoted; strings with the same value as \code{na} will
always be quoted.}

\item{append}{If \code{FALSE}, will overwrite existing file. If \code{TRUE},
will append to existing file. In both cases, if the file does not exist a new
file is created.}

\item{col_names}{If \code{FALSE}, column names will not be included at the top of the file. If \code{TRUE},
column names will be included. If not specified, \code{col_names} will take the opposite value given to \code{append}.}

\item{quote}{How to handle fields which contain characters that need to be
quoted.
\itemize{
\item \code{needed} - Values are only quoted if needed: if they contain a delimiter,
quote, or newline.
\item \code{all} - Quote all fields.
\item \code{none} - Never quote fields.
}}

\item{escape}{The type of escape to use when quotes are in the data.
\itemize{
\item \code{double} - quotes are escaped by doubling them.
\item \code{backslash} - quotes are escaped by a preceding backslash.
\item \code{none} - quotes are not escaped.
}}

\item{eol}{The end of line character to use. Most commonly either \code{"\\n"} for
Unix style newlines, or \code{"\\r\\n"} for Windows style newlines.}

\item{num_threads}{Number of threads to use when reading and materializing
vectors. If your data contains newlines within fields the parser will
automatically be forced to use a single thread only.}

\item{progress}{Display a progress bar? By default it will only display
in an interactive session and not while knitting a document. The display
is updated every 50,000 values and will only display if estimated reading
time is 5 seconds or more. The automatic progress bar can be disabled by
setting option \code{readr.show_progress} to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{path}{\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#deprecated}{\figure{lifecycle-deprecated.svg}{options: alt='[Deprecated]'}}}{\strong{[Deprecated]}} Use the \code{file} argument
instead.}

\item{quote_escape}{\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#deprecated}{\figure{lifecycle-deprecated.svg}{options: alt='[Deprecated]'}}}{\strong{[Deprecated]}} Use the \code{escape}
argument instead.}
}
\value{
\verb{write_*()} returns the input \code{x} invisibly.
}
\description{
The \verb{write_*()} family of functions are an improvement to analogous function such
as \code{\link[=write.csv]{write.csv()}} because they are approximately twice as fast. Unlike \code{\link[=write.csv]{write.csv()}},
these functions do not include row names as a column in the written file.
A generic function, \code{output_column()}, is applied to each variable
to coerce columns to suitable output.
}
\section{Output}{

Factors are coerced to character. Doubles are formatted to a decimal string
using the grisu3 algorithm. \code{POSIXct} values are formatted as ISO8601 with a
UTC timezone \emph{Note: \code{POSIXct} objects in local or non-UTC timezones will be
converted to UTC time before writing.}

All columns are encoded as UTF-8. \code{write_excel_csv()} and \code{write_excel_csv2()} also include a
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark}{UTF-8 Byte order mark}
which indicates to Excel the csv is UTF-8 encoded.

\code{write_excel_csv2()} and \code{write_csv2} were created to allow users with
different locale settings to save .csv files using their default settings
(e.g. \verb{;} as the column separator and \verb{,} as the decimal separator).
This is common in some European countries.

Values are only quoted if they contain a comma, quote or newline.

The \verb{write_*()} functions will automatically compress outputs if an appropriate extension is given.
Three extensions are currently supported: \code{.gz} for gzip compression, \code{.bz2} for bzip2 compression and
\code{.xz} for lzma compression.  See the examples for more information.

\examples{
\dontshow{
.old_wd <- setwd(tempdir())
}
# If only a file name is specified, write_()* will write
# the file to the current working directory.
write_csv(mtcars, "mtcars.csv")
write_tsv(mtcars, "mtcars.tsv")

# If you add an extension to the file name, write_()* will
# automatically compress the output.
write_tsv(mtcars, "mtcars.tsv.gz")
write_tsv(mtcars, "mtcars.tsv.bz2")
write_tsv(mtcars, "mtcars.tsv.xz")

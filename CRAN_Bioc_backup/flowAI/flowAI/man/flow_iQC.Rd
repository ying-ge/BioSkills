\title{Interactive quality control of Flow Cytometry Data}
\usage{
flow_iQC()
}
\description{
The call of the \code{flow_iQC} function opens a Shiny application that allows 
to perfom a complete and interactive quality control of an FCS file. The 
framework of the interactive quality control is complementary to the 
automatic one of the \code{flow_auto_qc} function. Hence, the anomalies 
are manually selected from the evaluation of three main properties of 
flow cytometry: 1) flow rate, 2) signal acquisition, 3) dynamic range.

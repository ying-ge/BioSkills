Title: Automatic and interactive quality control for flow cytometry
        data
Version: 1.32.0
Date: 2022-04-30
Author: Gianni Monaco, Hao Chen
Description: The package is able to perform an automatic or interactive quality
    control on FCS data acquired using flow cytometry instruments. By evaluating
    three different properties: 1) flow rate, 2) signal acquisition, 3) dynamic
    range, the quality control enables the detection and removal of anomalies.

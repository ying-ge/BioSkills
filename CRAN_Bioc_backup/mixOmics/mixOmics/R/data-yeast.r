#' Yeast metabolomic study
#' 
#' Two Saccharomyces Cerevisiae strains were compared under two different
#' environmental conditions, 37 metabolites expression are measured.
#' 
#' In this study, two Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains were used - wild-type
#' (WT) and mutant (MT), and were carried out in batch cultures under two
#' different environmental conditions, aerobic (AER) and anaerobic (ANA) in
#' standard mineral media with glucose as the sole carbon source. After
#' normalization and pre processing, the metabolomic data results in 37
#' metabolites and 55 samples which include 13 MT-AER, 14 MT-ANA, 15 WT-AER and
#' 13 WT-ANA samples

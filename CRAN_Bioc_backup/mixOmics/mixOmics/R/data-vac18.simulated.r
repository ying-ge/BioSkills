#' Simulated data based on the vac18 study for multilevel analysis
#' 
#' Simulated data based on the vac18 study to illustrate the use of the
#' multilevel analysis for one and two-factor analysis with sPLS-DA. This data
#' set contains the expression simulated of 500 genes.
#' 
#' In this cross-over design, repeated measurements are performed 12
#' experiments units (or unique subjects) for each of the 4 stimulations.
#' 
#' The simulation study was based on a mixed effects model (see reference for
#' details). Ten clusters of 100 genes were generated. Amongt those, 4 clusters
#' of genes discriminate the 4 stimulations (denoted LIPO5, GAG+, GAG- and NS)
#' as follows: \ -2 gene clusters discriminate (LIPO5, GAG+) versus (GAG-, NS)
#' \ -2 gene clusters discriminate LIPO5 versus GAG+, while GAG+ and NS have
#' the same effect \ -2 gene clusters discriminate GAG- versus NS, while LIPO5
#' and GAG+ have the same effect \ -the 4 remaining clusters represent noisy
#' signal (no stimulation effect) \
#' 
#' Only a subset of those genes are presented here (to save memory space).

\description{
This data set contains the expression measure of 3116 genes and 10 clinical
measurements for 64 subjects (rats) that were exposed to non-toxic,
moderately toxic or severely toxic doses of acetaminophen in a controlled
experiment.
}
\details{
The data come from a liver toxicity study (Bushel \emph{et al}., 2007) in
which 64 male rats of the inbred strain Fisher 344 were exposed to non-toxic
(50 or 150 mg/kg), moderately toxic (1500 mg/kg) or severely toxic (2000
mg/kg) doses of acetaminophen (paracetamol) in a controlled experiment.
Necropsies were performed at 6, 18, 24 and 48 hours after exposure and the
mRNA from the liver was extracted. Ten clinical chemistry measurements of
variables containing markers for liver injury are available for each subject
and the serum enzymes levels are measured numerically. The data were further
normalized and pre-processed by Bushel \emph{et al}. (2007).

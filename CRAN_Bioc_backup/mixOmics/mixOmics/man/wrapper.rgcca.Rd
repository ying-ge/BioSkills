\usage{
wrapper.rgcca(
  X,
  design = 1 - diag(length(X)),
  tau = rep(1, length(X)),
  ncomp = 1,
  keepX,
  scheme = "horst",
  scale = TRUE,
  init = "svd.single",
  tol = .Machine$double.eps,
  max.iter = 1000,
  near.zero.var = FALSE,
  all.outputs = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{a list of data sets (called 'blocks') matching on the same samples.
Data in the list should be arranged in samples x variables. \code{NA}s are
not allowed.}

\item{design}{numeric matrix of size (number of blocks in X) x (number of
blocks in X) with values between 0 and 1. Each value indicates the strenght
of the relationship to be modelled between two blocks using sGCCA; a value
of 0 indicates no relationship, 1 is the maximum value. If \code{Y} is
provided instead of \code{indY}, the \code{design} matrix is changed to
include relationships to \code{Y}.}

\item{tau}{numeric vector of length the number of blocks in \code{X}. Each
regularization parameter will be applied on each block and takes the value
between 0 (no regularisation) and 1. If tau = "optimal" the shrinkage
paramaters are estimated for each block and each dimension using the Schafer
and Strimmer (2005) analytical formula.}

\item{ncomp}{the number of components to include in the model. Default to 1.}

\item{keepX}{A vector of same length as X.  Each entry keepX[i] is the
number of X[[i]]-variables kept in the model.}

\item{scheme}{Either "horst", "factorial" or "centroid" (Default: "horst").}

\item{scale}{Logical. If scale = TRUE, each block is standardized to zero
means and unit variances (default: TRUE)}

\item{init}{Mode of initialization use in the algorithm, either by Singular
Value Decompostion of the product of each block of X with Y ("svd") or each
block independently ("svd.single") . Default to "svd.single".}

\item{tol}{Convergence stopping value.}

\item{max.iter}{integer, the maximum number of iterations.}

\item{near.zero.var}{Logical, see the internal \code{\link{nearZeroVar}}
function (should be set to TRUE in particular for data with many zero
values). Setting this argument to FALSE (when appropriate) will speed up the
computations. Default value is FALSE}

\item{all.outputs}{Logical. Computation can be faster when some specific
(and non-essential) outputs are not calculated. Default = \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
\code{wrapper.rgcca} returns an object of class \code{"rgcca"}, a
list that contains the following components:

\item{data}{the input data set (as a list).} \item{design}{the input
design.} \item{variates}{the sgcca components.} \item{loadings}{the loadings
for each block data set (outer wieght vector).} \item{loadings.star}{the
laodings, standardised.} \item{tau}{the input tau parameter.}
\item{scheme}{the input schme.} \item{ncomp}{the number of components
included in the model for each block.} \item{crit}{the convergence
criterion.} \item{AVE}{Indicators of model quality based on the Average
Variance Explained (AVE): AVE(for one block), AVE(outer model), AVE(inner
model)..} \item{names}{list containing the names to be used for individuals
and variables.} More details can be found in the references.

\description{
Wrapper function to perform Regularized Generalised Canonical Correlation
Analysis (rGCCA), a generalised approach for the integration of multiple
datasets. For more details, see the \code{help(rgcca)} from the \pkg{RGCCA}
package.
}
\details{
This wrapper function performs rGCCA (see \pkg{RGCCA}) with \eqn{1, \ldots
,}\code{ncomp} components on each block data set. A supervised or
unsupervised model can be run. For a supervised model, the
\code{\link{unmap}} function should be used as an input data set. More
details can be found on the package \pkg{RGCCA}.

data(nutrimouse)
# need to unmap the Y factor diet

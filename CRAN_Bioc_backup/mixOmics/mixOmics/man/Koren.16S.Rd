\title{16S microbiome atherosclerosis study}
\format{
A list containing two data sets, \code{data.TSS} and \code{data.raw}
and some meta data information: \describe{ \item{list("data.TSS")}{data
frame with 43 rows (samples) and 980 columns (OTUs). The prefiltered
normalised data using Total Sum Scaling normalisation.}
\item{list("data.raw")}{data frame with 43 rows (samples) and 980 columns
(OTUs). The prefiltered raw count OTU data which include a 1 offset (i.e. no
0 values).} \item{list("taxonomy")}{data frame with 980 rows (OTUs) and 7
columns indicating the taxonomy of each OTU.} \item{list("indiv")}{data
frame with 43 rows indicating sample meta data.}
\item{list("bodysite")}{factor of length 43 indicating the bodysite with
levels arterial plaque, saliva and stool.} }

\description{
The 16S data come from Koren et al. (2011) and compared the bodysites oral,
gut and plaque microbial communities in patients with atherosclerosis. The
data can be analysed with our mixMC module. The data include 43 samples
measured on 980 OTUs.

\details{
The data are from Koren et al. (2011) who examined the link between oral,
gut and plaque microbial communities in patients with atherosclerosis and
controls. Only healthy individuals were retained in the analysis. This study
contained partially repeated measures from multiple sites including 15
unique patients samples from saliva and stool, and 13 unique patients only
sampled from arterial plaque samples and we therefore considered a non
multilevel analysis for that experimental design. After prefiltering, the
data included 973 OTU for 43 samples. We strongly recommend to use log ratio
transformations on the \code{data.TSS} normalisd data, as implemented in the
PLS and PCA methods, see details on \url{ www.mixOmics.org/mixMC}.

The \code{data.raw} include a 1 offset in order to be log ratios transformed
after TSS normalisation. Consequently, the \code{data.TSS} are TSS
normalisation of \code{data.raw}. The CSS normalisation was performed on the
orignal data (including zero values)

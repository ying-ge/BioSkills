extracted.} }

\description{
This data set contains the expression of a random subset of 400 genes in 125
samples from 4 independent studies and 3 cell types.

\details{
This data set contains the expression of a random subset of 400 genes in 125
samples from 4 independent studies and 3 cell types. Those studies can be
combined and analysed using the MINT procedure.

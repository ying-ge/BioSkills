\title{ 
Combine geometries
}

\description{
Combine the geometries of one SpatVector with those of another. Geometries can be combined based on overlap, shared boundaries and distance (in that order of operation). 

The typical use-case of this method is when you are editing geometries and you have a number of small polygons in one SpatVector that should be part of the geometries of the another SpatVector; perhaps because they were small holes inbetween the borders of two SpatVectors.

To append SpatVectors use `rbind` and see methods like \code{intersect} and \code{union} for "normal" polygons combinations.

\usage{
\S4method{combineGeoms}{SpatVector,SpatVector}(x, y, overlap=TRUE, boundary=TRUE, distance=TRUE,
	append=TRUE, minover=0.1, maxdist=Inf, dissolve=TRUE, erase=TRUE)
}

\arguments{
  \item{x}{SpatVector of polygons}
  \item{y}{SpatVector of polygons geometries that are to be combined with \code{x}}
  \item{overlap}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, a geometry is combined with the geometry it has most overlap with, if the overlap is above \code{minover}}
  \item{boundary}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, a geometry is combined with the geometry it has most shared border with}
  \item{distance}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, a geometry is combined with the geometry it is nearest to}
  \item{append}{logical. Should remaining geometries be appended to the output? Not relevant if \code{distance=TRUE}}
  \item{minover}{numeric. The fraction of the geometry in \code{y} that overlaps with a geometry in \code{x}. Below this threshold, geometries are not considered overlapping}
  \item{maxdist}{numeric. Geometries further away from each other than this distance (in meters) will not be combined}
  \item{dissolve}{logical. Should internal boundaries be dissolved?}
  \item{erase}{logical. If \code{TRUE} no new overlapping areas are created}

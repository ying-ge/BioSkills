\title{ Draw a polygon, line, extent, or points }

\description{
Draw on a plot (map) to get a SpatVector or SpatExtent object for later use. After calling the function, start clicking on the map. When you are done, press \code{ESC}. You can also preset the maximum number of clicks.

Note that for many installations this does to work well on the default RStudio plotting device. To work around that, you can first run \code{dev.new(noRStudioGD = TRUE)} which will create a separate window for plotting, then use \code{plot()} followed by \code{draw()} and clicking on the map. It may also help to set your RStudio "Tools/Global Options/Appearance/Zoom" to 100%

\usage{
\S4method{draw}{character}(x="extent", col="red", lwd=2, id=FALSE, n=1000, xpd=TRUE, ...)
}

\arguments{
  \item{x}{character. The type of object to draw. One of "extent", "polygon", "line", or "points"}
  \item{col}{the color to be used}
  \item{lwd}{the width of the lines to be drawn}
  \item{id}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, a numeric ID is shown on the map}
  \item{n}{the maximum number of clicks (does not apply when \code{x=="extent"} in which case \code{n} is always 2)}  
  \item{xpd}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, you can draw outside the current plotting area}
  \item{...}{additional graphics arguments for drawing}

\title{4-Parameter Hill Equation for Stimuli-Response Curves}
\usage{
hillCurve(dose, HS, EC50, E_inf, E_ninf)
}
\arguments{
\item{dose}{\code{numeric()} A vector of \code{log10(dose)} values (or equivalent for
the stimuli being modelleled).}

\item{HS}{\code{numeric(1)} Hill coefficient (n) which defines the slope of the
dose-response curve at the mid-point. This parameter describes the degree
of sigmoidicity of the Hill curve. HS = 1 corresponds to the rectangular
hyperbola in dose-response space.}

\item{EC50}{\code{numeric(1)} The dose required to produce 50\% of the
theoretically maximal response in the system, \code{E_inf}. Should be in the same
units as \code{dose}!}

\item{E_inf}{\code{numeric(1)} Theoretical maximal response (minimal viability)
in the system as a proportion in the range \[0, 1\]. Note that since we are
predicting viability (percent of cells alive after treatment) instead of
response, this value should be low (i.e., more cell killing).}

\item{E_ninf}{\code{numeric(1)} Theoretical minimum response (basal response).
Defaults to 1, which should be the case for most viability experiments since
we expect no cell killing to occur prior to applying a treatment.}
}
\value{
\code{numeric()} Vector of predicted viabilities for the Hill curve defined
by \code{EC50}, \code{E_inf}, \code{E_ninf} and \code{HS} for each supplied value of \code{dose}.
}
\description{
Sigmoidal function which fits well to many stimuli-response associations
observed in biology and pharmacology. In the context of PharmacoGx we
are using it to model treatment-response assocations in cancer cell lines.

\title{Information of SAPS II score and outcome of 1,000 ICU patients.}
\format{A data frame with 1000 rows and 33 variables. The dataset contains, for each predictor of the SAPSII score,
both the clinical information and the weight of that variable in the score (the variable with the suffix '_NUM').
\describe{
  \item{outcome}{hospital outcome, numeric binary variable with values 1 (deceased) and 0 (alive).}
  \item{probSaps}{probability estimated by the SAPSII prognostic model.}
  \item{sapsScore}{SAPSII score.}
  \item{age,age_NUM}{age, factor variable with levels (in years): '<40', '40-59', '60-69', '70-74', '75-80', '>=80'.}
  \item{adm,adm_NUM}{type of admission, factor variable with 3 levels: 'unschSurg' (unscheduled surgery), 'med' (medical), 'schSurg' (scheduled surgery).}
  \item{chronic,chronic_NUM}{chronic diseases, factor variable with 4 levels: 'noChronDis' (no chronic disease), 'metCarc' (metastatic carcinoma), 'hemMalig' (hematologic malignancy), 'aids' (AIDS).}
  \item{gcs,gcs_NUM}{Glasgow Coma Scale, factor variable with 5 levels: '3-5', '6-8', '9-10', '11-13', '14-15'.}

\description{
A dataset containing clinical information of 1,000 patients admitted to Italian Intesive Care Units
joining the GiViTI network (\emph{Gruppo Italiano per la valutazione degli interventi in Terapia Intensiva},
Italian Group for the Evaluation of the Interventions in Intensive Care Units). The data has
been collected within the ProSAFE project, an Italian observational study based on a continuous
data collection of clinical data in more than 200 Italian ICUs. The purpose of the project is a
continuous surveillance of the quality of care provided in the participating centres.
The actual values of the variables have been modified to protect subject confidentiality.
}
\details{
The data contain the information to apply the SAPSII model, a prognostic model developed to
predict hospital mortality (Le Gall et al., 1993).
Both the computed SAPSII score and the associated probability of death are variables of the dataset.
The score is an integer number ranging from 0 to 163 describing the severity of the patient (the higher
the score, the more severe the patient). The probability is computed from the score through the formula
reported in the original paper. The dataset contains also the hospital survival of the patients.

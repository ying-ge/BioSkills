\usage{
make_base(
  heightmap,
  basedepth = 0,
  basecolor = "grey20",
  zscale = 1,
  soil = FALSE,
  soil_freq = 0.1,
  soil_levels = 8,
  soil_color1 = "black",

}
\arguments{
\item{heightmap}{A two-dimensional matrix, where each entry in the matrix is the elevation at that point. All points are assumed to be evenly spaced.}

\item{basedepth}{Default `0`.}

\item{basecolor}{Default `grey20`.}

\item{zscale}{Default `1`. The ratio between the x and y spacing (which are assumed to be equal) and the z axis. For example, if the elevation levels are in units
of 1 meter and the grid values are separated by 10 meters, `zscale` would be 10.}
}
\description{
Makes the base below the 3D elevation map.

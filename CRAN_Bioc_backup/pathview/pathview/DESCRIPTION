Description: Pathview is a tool set for pathway based data integration
        and visualization. It maps and renders a wide variety of
        biological data on relevant pathway graphs. All users need is
        to supply their data and specify the target pathway. Pathview
        automatically downloads the pathway graph data, parses the data
        file, maps user data to the pathway, and render pathway graph
        with the mapped data. In addition, Pathview also seamlessly
        integrates with pathway and gene set (enrichment) analysis tools for
        large-scale and fully automated analysis.

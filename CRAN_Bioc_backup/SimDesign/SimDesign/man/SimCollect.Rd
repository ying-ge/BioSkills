\arguments{
\item{dir}{a \code{character} vector pointing to the directory name containing the \code{.rds} files.
All \code{.rds} files in this directory will be used after first checking
their status with \code{\link{SimCheck}}. For greater specificity use the
\code{files} argument}

\item{files}{a \code{character} vector containing the names of the simulation's final \code{.rds} files.}

\item{filename}{(optional) name of .rds file to save aggregate simulation file to. If not specified
then the results will only be returned in the R console.}

\item{select}{a character vector indicating columns to variables to select from the
\code{SimExtract(what='results')} information. This is mainly useful when RAM is an issue
given simulations with many stored estimates. Default includes the results objects
in their entirety, though to omit all internally stored simulation results pass the
character \code{'NONE'}. To investigate the stored warnings and error messages in isolation
pass \code{'WARNINGS'} or \code{'ERRORS'}, respectively}

\item{check.only}{logical; for larger simulations file sets, such as those generated by
\code{\link{runArraySimulation}}, return the design conditions that do no satisfy the
\code{target.reps} and throw warning if files are unexpectedly missing (the latter
criterion is reported from \code{\link{SimCheck}}, which can be used to obtain the
conditions associated with the missing files)}

\item{target.reps}{(optional) number of replications to check against to evaluate whether
the simulation files returned the desired number of replications. If missing, the highest
detected value from the collected set of replication information will be used}

\item{warning_details}{logical; include the aggregate of the warnings to be extracted via
\code{\link{SimExtract}}?}

\item{error_details}{logical; include the aggregate of the errors to be extracted via
\code{\link{SimExtract}}?}

\item{gc}{logical; explicitly call R's garbage collector \code{\link{gc}}? May help when
memory is severely constrained during the file read-ins. Otherwise, the \code{select}
argument should be used to take more memory-friendly subsets}

\item{...}{not used}
}
\value{
returns a \code{data.frame/tibble} with the (weighted) average/aggregate
  of the simulation results
}
\description{
This function collects and aggregates the results from
\code{SimDesign}'s \code{\link{runSimulation}} into a single
objects suitable for post-analyses, or combines all the saved results directories and combines
them into one. This is useful when results are run piece-wise on one node (e.g., 500 replications
in one batch, 500 again at a later date, though be careful about the \code{\link{set.seed}}
use as the random numbers will tend to correlate the more it is used) or run independently across different
nodes/computing cores (e.g., see \code{\link{runArraySimulation}}.

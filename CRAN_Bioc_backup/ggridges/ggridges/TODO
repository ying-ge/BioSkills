Things to do
================================
- Add position_points_beeswarm() and position_points_quasirandom()
- Add stat for categorical data, as described here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/47614529/4975218
- In legend drawing code, can we detect the presence of jittered points from the input data, not from the parameter setting?

\title{Xgboost importance}
\usage{
getImpXgboost(x, y, nrounds = 5, verbose = 0, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{data frame of predictors including shadows.}

\item{y}{response vector.}

\item{nrounds}{Number of rounds; passed to the underlying \code{\link[xgboost]{xgboost}} call.}

\item{verbose}{Verbosity level of xgboost; either 0 (silent) or 1 (progress reports). Passed to the underlying \code{\link[xgboost]{xgboost}} call.}

\item{...}{other parameters passed to the underlying \code{\link[xgboost]{xgboost}} call.
Similarly as \code{nrounds} and \code{verbose}, they are relayed from \code{...} of \code{\link{Boruta}}.
For convenience, this function sets \code{nrounds} to 5 and verbose to 0, but this can be overridden.}
}
\description{
This function is intended to be given to a \code{getImp} argument of \code{\link{Boruta}} function to be called by the Boruta algorithm as an importance source.
This functionality is inspired by the Python package BoostARoota by Chase DeHan.
In practice, due to the eager way XgBoost works, this adapter changes Boruta into minimal optimal method, hence I strongly recommend against using this.
}
\note{
Only dense matrix interface is supported; all predictions given to \code{\link{Boruta}} call have to be numeric (not integer).
Categorical features should be split into indicator attributes.

  abstract ={Motivation: Analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data revealed that the vast majority of human genes express multiple mRNA isoforms, produced by alternative pre-mRNA splicing and other mechanisms, and that most alternative isoforms vary in expression between human tissues. As RNA-Seq datasets grow in size, it remains challenging to visualize isoform expression across multiple samples.Results: To help address this problem, we present Sashimi plots, a quantitative visualization of aligned RNA-Seq reads that enables quantitative comparison of exon usage across samples or experimental conditions. Sashimi plots can be made using the Broad Integrated Genome Viewer or with a stand-alone command line program.Availability and implementation: Software code and documentation freely available here: http://miso.readthedocs.org/en/fastmiso/sashimi.htmlContact: mesirov@broadinstitute.org, airoldi@fas.harvard.edu or cburge@mit.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

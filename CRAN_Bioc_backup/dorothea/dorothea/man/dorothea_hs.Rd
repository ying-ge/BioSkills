\description{
A table reporting signed human TF-target interactions. This database covers
  in total 1395 TFs targeting 20,244 genes with 486,676 unique interactions.
  In addition, each TF is accompanied with an empirical confidence level that
  was derived from the number of supporting evidences for this
  TF/interaction. The range is from A (high quality) to E (low quality).

Internal wateRmelon functions for calculating betas 
}
\description{
db1 is used for quantile normalizing methylated together with unmethylated (dye bias methods nanet, nanes, danes and danet.  dfs* functions are used for smoothing the background equalization in methods whose names start with d (daten etc).
}
\usage{
db1(mn, un)
dfsfit(mn, onetwo, roco=substring(colnames(mn), regexpr("R0[1-9]C0[1-9]", colnames(mn))), ... )

dfs2(x, onetwo)

}
\arguments{

  \item{mn, x}{
matrix of methylated signal intensities, each column representing a sample 
(default method), or an object for which a method is available. For dfsfit 
and dfs2 this can also be a matrix of unmethylated intensities.
   }

  \item{un}{
matrix of unmethylated signal intensities, each column representing a sample
(default method) or NULL when mn is an object containing methylated and 
unmethylated values.
  }
  

  \item{onetwo}{
character vector or factor of length nrow(mn) indicating assay type 'I'
or 'II' 
}

   \item{roco}{ roco for dfsfit giving Sentrix rows and columns. 
This allows a background gradient model to be fit.  This is split from 
data column names by default.  roco=NULL disables model fitting
(and speeds up processing), otherwise roco can be supplied as a 
character vector of strings like 'R01C01' (3rd and 6th characters used).

\details{
db1    - quantile normalizes methylated against unmethylated (basic function for
dyebuy* dye bias methods).
dfsfit - corrects the difference in backgrounds between type I and type II assays and fits a linear model to Sentrix rows and columns if these are available to improve precision where there is a background gradient.
dfs2   - finds the difference between type I and type II assay backgrounds for one or more samples.
}
\value{
db1    - a list of 2 matrices of intensities, methylated and unmethylated
dfsfit - a matrix of adjusted intensities
dfs2   - a background offset value

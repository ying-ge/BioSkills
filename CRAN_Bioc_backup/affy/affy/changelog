###ask laurent: whats wrong with CDF.example
----> For some (mysterious) reasons, save(..., ascii=TRUE) is behaving wrong on my linux box
at home. I saved it  with ascii=FALSE (portability could be .....)   LG
###why not have a slot in cel.container denoting the default Cdf
###then change all functions so that one does not need to pass Cdf
###with this and some methods we maybe able to get rid of Plobs entirely 
###maybe this is a version 2.0 task.
----> Yep... mentioned in the file TODO for some time now...


Yo, Laurentz takin' the mike now:

- fixed a problem with CDF.example.RData
- updated the documentation for the normalize functions
(should keep 'R CMD check happy')
- introduced a generic method 'normalize.methods' (Plob and Cel.container)
- variables related to normalize.methods (normalize.Cel.container.methods and
normalize.Plob.methods) are created.
- changed the methods names 'normalize.Cel.XYZ' to 'normalize.Cel.container.XYZ'
(more consistent). Documentation shoudlhave been updated accordingly.
- removed image.Cel.Rd
- fixed the method image for Cel-class. Added better ways of asking the function
to mask areas. updated the documentation accordingly.
- did a bit more with affy.Rnw (in inst/doc/). Now it goes through Sweave ok.
- update the file 'TODO'



still talkin'...:

- cleaned read_cdffile.c (no more warnings)
- made something usable for the documentation of 'normalize' (hopefully)
- various fixes in the documentation
- Did a bit more with affy.Rnw
- the example in generateExprSet-methods.Rd is commented out... seems to work
on the command line but fails through 'R CMD check' (??!?!!!?)
- the 'normalize' part being done (apart of possible bugs), we reached the version
number 0.8.0
- started to finish the part about generateExprSet

- accessor function sd in Cel moved to spotsd

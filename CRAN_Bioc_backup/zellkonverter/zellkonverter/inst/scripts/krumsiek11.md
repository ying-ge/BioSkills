The `krumsiek11.h5ad` file contains an AnnData object with a simulated myeloid
progenitor scRNA-seq dataset. It was created using the\
`scanpy.datasets.krumsiek11()` function in the **scanpy** Python package and
saved as a `.h5ad` file using the `adata.write()` method. This file is included
in **zellkonverter** for tests and examples that require reading a `.h5ad` file
from disk. More details on this dataset can be found in the **scanpy**
documentation at https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/scanpy.datasets.krumsiek11.html#scanpy.datasets.krumsiek11.

\title{Multiple High Outliers at Different measurements}
\description{
These are a handful of experimentally derived datasets from the wet-laboratory.
These all have numerical errors in other dose-response curve-packages, but not using these methods.
This data set exemplifies the case of multiple outliers as well as a small number of observations per dose measurement.

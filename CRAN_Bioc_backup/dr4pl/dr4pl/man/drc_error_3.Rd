\title{Support Problem and Outliers at a Single Dose Level}
\description{
These are a handful of experimentally derived datasets from the wet-laboratory.
These all have numerical errors in other dose-response curve-packages, but not using these methods.
This data set exemplifies the case of multiple outliers at a single dose measurement as well as the support problem.

  a <- dr4pl(Response~Dose, data = drc_error_3, method.init = "Mead", method.robust = "Huber")

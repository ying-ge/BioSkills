     2*smooth.region (default smooth.region=2) markers in a chromosome.

   o row numbers of the segments are automatically returned as the object
     segRows in the output.  The print method shows it if showSegRows=TRUE.

   o changed to a faster algorithm for calculating the max t-statistic

   o changed to a faster code for undoing edge effects (redundant perm)

   o added basic functions exon.segment and exon.changepoint (workhorse)
     These functions are used for finding a translocation using binary
     segmentation.  The data for this should be properly normalized.

1.11.2 became 1.12.0 in Bioconductor 2.1 & =1.13.0 now
------------------------------------------------------

Changes in Version 1.11.2

   o Added a p-value function for the change-points.  This is based on 
     binary segmentation and not necessarily correct but gives an idea
     of the relative importance of the change-points.

Changes in Version 1.11.1

   o Changed Venkat's affiliation from MSKCC to Columbia University


1.9.3 became 1.10.0 in Bioconductor 2.0 & =1.11.0 now

Changes in Version 1.9.3

   o Added warning that windowing will be deprecated in the next version.

Changes in Version 1.9.2

   o Added code to not bother with p-values and split the segment when the
     maximal T is large (p-value will be tiny if T > 7).

   o Added code to not split when the maximal T is small (fixes a numerical
     problem where a constant large segment can have a significant split).

Changes in Version 1.9.1

   o The mod function in fortran inflicts serious time penalty --
     code rewritten to fix it


1.5.3 became 1.6(8).0 in Bioconductor 1.8(9) & =1.9.0 now

1.2.5 became 1.4.0 in Bioconductor 1.7 & =1.5.0 in the development branch
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in Version 1.2.5

   o Updated the vignette to include references to additional features.

Changes in Version 1.2.4

   o Seg fault occurs if window.size is set when hybrid method is used.
     Fixed by setting window.size to be NULL in the function segment.

   o Added options to plot command to draw line at y=0 and control its 
     color and lwd of all lines.

   o If ylim is missing it's calculated from all the data instead of just
     the first sample.

Changes in Version 1.2.3

   o Modifications to the plot function to make par("ask") behave better.

Changes in Version 1.2.2

   o Modified the plot function.  X-axis is either the index or (cumulative) 
     map location. Incorporate col, pch, ylim etc. to provide better control
     over plots.

Changes in Version 1.2.1

   o Added the hybrid method for computing p-values to determine splits.  This
     speeds up the computations considerably and so has been made the default.

Description: This package is to find SNV/Indel differences between two
        bam files with near relationship in a way of pairwise
        comparison thourgh each base position across the genome region
        of interest. The difference is inferred by fisher test and
        euclidean distance, the input of which is the base count
        (A,T,G,C) in a given position and read counts for indels that
        span no less than 2bp on both sides of indel region.

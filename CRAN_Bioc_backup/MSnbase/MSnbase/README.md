# The `MSnbase` package

<img align = "right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bioconductor/BiocStickers/master/MSnbase/MSnbase.png" height="200">

[**MSnbase**](https://lgatto.github.io/MSnbase/) is an R/Bioconductor
package that provides infrastructure for plotting, manipulation and
processing mass spectrometry and proteomics data. The project was
started by [Laurent Gatto](https://lgatto.github.io/) in October 2010
(Mon Oct 4 23:35:23 2010, according to the git log) and has, since
then, benefited from
[various contributions](https://lgatto.github.io/msnbase-contribs/), in
particular [Sebastian Gibb](https://sebastiangibb.de/)
and [Johannes Rainer](https://github.com/jorainer).

The official package page is the Bioconductor landing page
([release](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MSnbase.html) or
[devel](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/MSnbase.html) versions). The
[github page](https://github.com/lgatto/MSnbase) page is for active
development, issue tracking and forking/pulling purposes.

To get an overview of the package, see the
[*MSnbase-demo*](https://lgatto.github.io/MSnbase/articles/v01-MSnbase-demo.html)
vignette. More vignettes are available in the *Articles* tab.

## Installation

To install the package:


```r
install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("MSnbase")
```

If you need the github version (not recommended unless you know what
you are doing), use


```r
BiocManager::install("lgatto/MSnbase")
```

## Questions

General questions should be asked on
the [Bioconductor support forum](https://support.bioconductor.org/),
using `MSnbase` to tag the question. Feel also free to open a

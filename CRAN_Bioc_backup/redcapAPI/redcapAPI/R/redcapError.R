#  redcapError
#
#  The current intent of this is to consistently deal
#  with API errors, and possibly translate them into
#  a meaningful message for users.
#
#  There is a legacy intent could potentially be deprecated
#  in the future for supporting "Classic", i.e. version < 6.0.0,
#  REDCap projects. The interface for this ignores
#  certain errors by default which would occur when interacting
#  with these older projects. At present it is doubtful
#  the current framework would work with a project of this age.
#
#  Part of this legacy support also involved an option
#  'redcap_error_handler' which if set to anything but
#  NULL it will error on all cases.
redcapError <- function(x)
{
  error_handling <- getOption("redcap_error_handling")

  # Legacy project ignore errors unless option given to treat as errors

              "ERROR: You cannot export arms for classic projects",
              "ERROR: You cannot export events for classic projects",
              "ERROR: You cannot export form/event mappings for classic projects")

  # Translate network error codes to user relevant message

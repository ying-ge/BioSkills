abstract = {We introduce DECOMP, a tool that computes the sum formula
                  of all molecules whose mass equals the input
                  mass. This problem arises frequently in biochemistry
                  and mass spectrometry (MS), when we know the
                  molecular mass of a protein, DNA, or metabolite
                  fragment but have no other information. A closely
                  related problem is known as the Money Changing
                  Problem (MCP), where all masses are positive
                  integers. Recently, efficient algorithms have been
                  developed for the MCP, which DECOMP applies to real
                  valued MS data. The excellent performance of this
                  method on proteomic and metabolomic MS data has
                  recently been demonstrated. DECOMP has an
                  easy-to-use graphical interface, which caters for
                  both types of users: those interested in solving MCP
                  instances and those submitting MS data.},

abstract = {Motivation: High-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) is
                  among the most widely used technologies in
                  metabolomics. Metabolites participate in almost all
                  cellular processes, but most metabolites still
                  remain uncharacterized. Determination of the sum
                  formula is a crucial step in the identification of
                  an unknown metabolite, as it reduces its possible
                  structures to a hopefully manageable set. Results:
                  We present a method for determining the sum formula
                  of a metabolite solely from its mass and the natural
                  distribution of its isotopes. Our input is a
                  measured isotope pattern from a high resolution mass
                  spectrometer, and we want to find those molecules
                  that best match this pattern. Our method is
                  computationally efficient, and results on
                  experimental data are very promising: For orthogonal
                  time-of-flight mass spectrometry, we correctly
                  identify sum formulas for more than 90\% of the
                  molecules, ranging in mass up to 1000
                  Da. Availability: SIRIUS is available under the LGPL

                  increases rapidly. To efficiently analyze mass
                  spectra of such molecules, we define several
                  additive invariants extracted from the input and

abstract = {The Money Changing Problem (MCP) can be stated as follows:
                  Given $k$ positive integers $a_1< \ldots < a_k$ and
                  a query integer $M$, is there a linear combination
                  $\sum_i c_ia_i = M$ with non-negative integers
                  $c_i$, a \emph{decomposition} of $M$? If so, produce
                  one or all such decompositions. The largest integer
                  without such a decomposition is called the
                  \emph{Frobenius number} $g(a_1,\ldots,a_k)$. A data
                  structure called {\em residue table} of $a_1$ words
                  can be used to compute the Frobenius number in time
                  $O(a_1)$. We present an intriguingly simple
                  algorithm for computing the residue table which runs
                  in time $O(ka_1)$, with no additional memory
                  requirements, outperforming the best previously
                  known algorithm. Simulations show that it performs
                  well even on 'hard' instances from the
                  literature. In addition, we can employ the residue
                  table to answer MCP decision instances in constant
                  time, and a slight modification of size $O(a_1)$ to
                  compute one decomposition for a query $M$. Note that
                  since both, computing the Frobenius number and MCP
                  (decision) are NP-hard, one cannot expect to find an
                  algorithm that is polynomial in the size of the
                  input, i.e., in $k,\log a_k$, and $\log M$. We then
                  give an algorithm which, using a modification of the
                  residue table, also constructible in $O(ka_1)$ time,
                  computes all decompositions of a query integer
                  $M$. Its worst-case running time is $O(ka_1)$ for
                  each decomposition, thus the total runtime depends
                  only on the output size and is independent of the
                  size of query $M$ itself. We apply our latter
                  algorithm to interpreting mass spectrometry (MS)
                  peaks: Due to its high speed and accuracy, MS is now
                  the method of choice in protein
                  identification. Interpreting individual peaks is one
                  of the recurring subproblems in analyzing MS data;
                  the task is to identify sample molecules whose mass
                  the peak possibly represents. This can be stated as
                  an MCP instance, with the masses of the individual
                  amino acids as the $k$ integers $a_1,\ldots,
                  a_k$. Our simulations show that our algorithm is
                  fast on real data and is well suited for generating
                  candidates for peak interpretation.},

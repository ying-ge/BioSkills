\details{
  The function \code{Jmulti}
  generalises \code{\link{Jest}} (for unmarked point
  patterns) and \code{\link{Jdot}} and \code{\link{Jcross}} (for
  multitype point patterns) to arbitrary marked point patterns.

  Suppose \eqn{X_I}{X[I]}, \eqn{X_J}{X[J]} are subsets, possibly
  overlapping, of a marked point process. Define
  \deqn{J_{IJ}(r) = \frac{1 - G_{IJ}(r)}{1 - F_J(r)}}{
    J[IJ](r) = (1 - G[IJ](r))/(1 - F[J](r))}
  where \eqn{F_J(r)}{F[J](r)} is the cumulative distribution function of
  the distance from a fixed location to the nearest point
  of \eqn{X_J}{X[J]}, and \eqn{G_{IJ}(r)}{GJ(r)}
  is the distribution function of the distance
  from a typical point of  \eqn{X_I}{X[I]} to the nearest distinct point of
  \eqn{X_J}{X[J]}. 

  The argument \code{X} must be a point pattern (object of class
  \code{"ppp"}) or any data that are acceptable to \code{\link[spatstat.geom]{as.ppp}}.

  The arguments \code{I} and \code{J} specify two subsets of the
  point pattern. They may be any type of subset indices, for example,
  logical vectors of length equal to \code{npoints(X)},
  or integer vectors with entries in the range 1 to
  \code{npoints(X)}, or negative integer vectors.

  Alternatively, \code{I} and \code{J} may be \bold{functions}
  that will be applied to the point pattern \code{X} to obtain
  index vectors. If \code{I} is a function, then evaluating
  \code{I(X)} should yield a valid subset index. This option
  is useful when generating simulation envelopes using
  \code{\link{envelope}}.

  It is assumed that \code{X} can be treated
  as a realisation of a stationary (spatially homogeneous) 
  random spatial point process in the plane, observed through
  a bounded window.
  The window (which is specified in \code{X} as \code{Window(X)})
  may have arbitrary shape.
  Biases due to edge effects are
  treated in the same manner as in \code{\link{Jest}}.

  The argument \code{r} is the vector of values for the
  distance \eqn{r} at which \eqn{J_{IJ}(r)}{J[IJ](r)} should be evaluated. 
  It is also used to determine the breakpoints
  (in the sense of \code{\link{hist}})
  for the computation of histograms of distances. The reduced-sample and
  Kaplan-Meier estimators are computed from histogram counts. 
  In the case of the Kaplan-Meier estimator this introduces a discretisation
  error which is controlled by the fineness of the breakpoints.

  First-time users would be strongly advised not to specify \code{r}.
  However, if it is specified, \code{r} must satisfy \code{r[1] = 0}, 
  and \code{max(r)} must be larger than the radius of the largest disc 
  contained in the window. Furthermore, the successive entries of \code{r}
  must be finely spaced.

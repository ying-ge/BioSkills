\details{
  The \eqn{J} function (Van Lieshout and Baddeley, 1996)
  of a stationary point process is defined as 
  \deqn{J(r) = \frac{1-G(r)}{1-F(r)} }{ %
    J(r) = (1-G(r))/(1-F(r))}
  where \eqn{G(r)} is the nearest neighbour distance distribution
  function of the point process (see \code{\link{Gest}}) 
  and \eqn{F(r)} is its empty space function (see \code{\link{Fest}}).

  For a completely random (uniform Poisson) point process,
  the \eqn{J}-function is identically equal to \eqn{1}. 
  Deviations \eqn{J(r) < 1} or \eqn{J(r) > 1}
  typically indicate spatial clustering or spatial regularity, respectively.
  The \eqn{J}-function is one of the few characteristics that can be
  computed explicitly for a wide range of point processes. 
  See Van Lieshout and Baddeley (1996), Baddeley et al (2000),
  Thonnes and Van Lieshout (1999)  for further information.

  An estimate of \eqn{J} derived from a spatial point pattern dataset
  can be used in exploratory data analysis and formal inference
  about the pattern. The estimate of \eqn{J(r)} is compared against the 
  constant function \eqn{1}.
  Deviations \eqn{J(r) < 1} or \eqn{J(r) > 1}
  may suggest spatial clustering or spatial regularity, respectively.

  This algorithm estimates the \eqn{J}-function
  from the point pattern \code{X}. It assumes that \code{X} can be treated
  as a realisation of a stationary (spatially homogeneous) 
  random spatial point process in the plane, observed through
  a bounded window. 
  The window (which is specified in \code{X} as \code{Window(X)})
  may have arbitrary shape. 

  The argument \code{X} is interpreted as a point pattern object 
  (of class \code{"ppp"}, see \code{\link[spatstat.geom]{ppp.object}}) and can
  be supplied in any of the formats recognised by
  \code{\link[spatstat.geom]{as.ppp}()}. 

  The functions \code{\link{Fest}} and \code{\link{Gest}} are called to 
  compute estimates of \eqn{F(r)} and \eqn{G(r)} respectively.
  These estimates are then combined by simply taking the ratio
  \eqn{J(r) = (1-G(r))/(1-F(r))}.

  In fact several different estimates are computed
  using different edge corrections (Baddeley, 1998).

  The Kaplan-Meier estimate (returned as \code{km}) is the ratio 
  \code{J = (1-G)/(1-F)} of the Kaplan-Meier estimates of
  \eqn{1-F} and \eqn{1-G} computed by
  \code{\link{Fest}} and \code{\link{Gest}} respectively.
  This is computed if \code{correction=NULL} or if \code{correction}
  includes \code{"km"}.

  The Hanisch-style estimate (returned as \code{han}) is the ratio 
  \code{J = (1-G)/(1-F)} where \code{F} is the Chiu-Stoyan estimate of
  \eqn{F} and \code{G} is the Hanisch estimate of \eqn{G}.
  This is computed if \code{correction=NULL} or if \code{correction}
  includes \code{"cs"} or \code{"han"}.

  The reduced-sample or border corrected estimate
  (returned as \code{rs}) is
  the same ratio \code{J = (1-G)/(1-F)}
  of the border corrected estimates. 
  This is computed if \code{correction=NULL} or if \code{correction}
  includes \code{"rs"} or \code{"border"}.

  These edge-corrected estimators are slightly biased for \eqn{J}, 
  since they are ratios
  of approximately unbiased estimators.
  The logarithm of the
  Kaplan-Meier estimate is exactly unbiased for \eqn{\log J}{log J}.

  The uncorrected estimate (returned as \code{un}
  and computed only if \code{correction} includes \code{"none"})
  is the ratio \code{J = (1-G)/(1-F)}
  of the uncorrected (``raw'') estimates of the survival functions
  of \eqn{F} and \eqn{G},
  which are the empirical distribution functions of the 
  empty space distances \code{Fest(X,\dots)$raw}
  and of the nearest neighbour distances 
  \code{Gest(X,\dots)$raw}. The uncorrected estimates
  of \eqn{F} and \eqn{G} are severely biased.
  However the uncorrected estimate of \eqn{J}
  is approximately unbiased (if the process is close to Poisson);
  it is insensitive to edge effects, and should be used when
  edge effects are severe (see Baddeley et al, 2000).
  
  The algorithm for \code{\link{Fest}}
  uses two discrete approximations which are controlled
  by the parameter \code{eps} and by the spacing of values of \code{r}
  respectively. See \code{\link{Fest}} for details.
  First-time users are strongly advised not to specify these arguments.

  Note that the value returned by \code{Jest} includes 
  the output of \code{\link{Fest}} and \code{\link{Gest}}
  as attributes (see the last example below).
  If the user is intending to compute the \code{F,G} and \code{J}
  functions for the point pattern, it is only necessary to
  call \code{Jest}.

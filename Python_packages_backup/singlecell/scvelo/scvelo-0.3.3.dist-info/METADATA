# scVelo - RNA velocity generalized through dynamical modeling

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31883718/67709134-a0989480-f9bd-11e9-8ae6-f6391f5d95a0.png" width="400px" align="left">

**scVelo** is a scalable toolkit for RNA velocity analysis in single cells; RNA velocity
enables the recovery of directed dynamic information by leveraging splicing kinetics
<sup>[1](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0414-6)</sup>. scVelo collects different
methods for inferring RNA velocity using an expectation-maximization framework
<sup>[2](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-020-0591-3)</sup>, deep generative modeling
<sup>[3](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-023-01994-w)</sup>,
or metabolically labeled transcripts<sup>[4](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.19.549685)</sup>.

## scVelo's key applications

-   estimate RNA velocity to study cellular dynamics.
-   identify putative driver genes and regimes of regulatory changes.
-   infer a latent time to reconstruct the temporal sequence of transcriptomic events.
-   estimate reaction rates of transcription, splicing and degradation.
-   use statistical tests, e.g., to detect different kinetics regimes.

Description: MAGIC (Markov affinity-based graph imputation of cells) is a
    method for addressing technical noise in single-cell data, including
    under-sampling of mRNA molecules, often termed "dropout" which can
    severely obscure important gene-gene relationships. MAGIC shares
    information across similar cells, via data diffusion, to denoise the
    cell count matrix and fill in missing transcripts. Read more: van Dijk

Markov Affinity-based Graph Imputation of Cells (MAGIC) is an algorithm for denoising and imputation of single cells applied to single-cell RNA sequencing data, as described in Van Dijk D *et al.* (2018), *Recovering Gene Interactions from Single-Cell Data Using Data Diffusion*, Cell <https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(18)30724-4>.

* MAGIC imputes missing data values on sparse data sets, restoring the structure of the data
* It also proves dimensionality reduction and gene expression visualizations
* MAGIC can be performed on a variety of datasets
* Here, we show the usage of MAGIC on a toy dataset
* You can view further examples of MAGIC on real data in our notebooks under `inst/examples`:

## Installation

To use MAGIC, you will need to install both the R and Python packages.

If `python` or `pip` are not installed, you will need to install them. We recommend [Miniconda3](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) to install Python and `pip` together, or otherwise you can install `pip` from https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/.

#### Installation from CRAN

In R, run this command to install MAGIC and all dependencies:

```{r install_Rmagic, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("Rmagic")
```

In a terminal, run the following command to install the Python repository.

```{bash install_python_magic, eval=FALSE}
pip install --user magic-impute
```

#### Installaton from source

To install the very latest version of MAGIC, you can install from GitHub with the following commands run in a terminal.

```{bash install_magic_source, eval=FALSE}
git clone https://github.com/KrishnaswamyLab/MAGIC
cd MAGIC/python
python setup.py install --user
cd ../Rmagic
R CMD INSTALL .
```

## Quick Start

If you have loaded a data matrix `data` in R (cells on rows, genes on columns) you can run PHATE as follows:

```{r quick start, eval=FALSE}
library(phateR)
data_phate <- phate(data)
```

## Tutorial

#### Extra packages for the tutorial

We'll install a couple more tools for this tutorial.

```{r install_extras, eval=FALSE}
if (!require(viridis)) install.packages("viridis")
if (!require(ggplot2)) install.packages("ggplot2")
if (!require(phateR)) install.packages("phateR")
```

If you have never used PHATE, you should also install PHATE from the command line as follows:

```{bash install_python_phate, eval=FALSE}
pip install --user phate
```

### Loading packages

We load the Rmagic package and a few others for convenience functions.

```{r load_packages}
library(Rmagic)
library(ggplot2)
library(viridis)
library(phateR)
```

### Loading data

The example data is located in the MAGIC R package.

```{r load_data}
# load data
data(magic_testdata)
magic_testdata[1:5, 1:10]
```

### Running MAGIC

Running MAGIC is as simple as running the `magic` function.

```{r run_magic}
# run MAGIC
data_MAGIC <- magic(magic_testdata, genes = c("VIM", "CDH1", "ZEB1"))
```

We can plot the data before and after MAGIC to visualize the results.

```{r plot_raw}
ggplot(magic_testdata) +
  geom_point(aes(VIM, CDH1, colour = ZEB1)) +
  scale_colour_viridis(option = "B")
```

The data suffers from dropout to the point that we cannot infer anything about the gene-gene relationships.

```{r plot_magic}
ggplot(data_MAGIC) +
  geom_point(aes(VIM, CDH1, colour = ZEB1)) +
  scale_colour_viridis(option = "B")
```

As you can see, the gene-gene relationships are much clearer after MAGIC.

The data is sometimes a little too smooth - we can decrease `t` from the automatic value to reduce the amount of diffusion. We pass the original result to the argument `init` to avoid recomputing intermediate steps.

```{r plot_reduced_t}
data_MAGIC <- magic(magic_testdata, genes = c("VIM", "CDH1", "ZEB1"), t = 6, init = data_MAGIC)
ggplot(data_MAGIC) +
  geom_point(aes(VIM, CDH1, colour = ZEB1)) +
  scale_colour_viridis(option = "B")
```


We can look at the entire smoothed matrix with `genes='all_genes'`, passing the original result to the argument `init` to avoid recomputing intermediate steps. Note that this matrix may be large and could take up a lot of memory.

```{r run_magic_full_matrix}
data_MAGIC <- magic(magic_testdata, genes = "all_genes", t = 6, init = data_MAGIC)
as.data.frame(data_MAGIC)[1:5, 1:10]
```

### Visualizing MAGIC values on PCA

We can visualize the results of MAGIC on PCA as follows.

```{r run_pca}
data_MAGIC_PCA <- as.data.frame(prcomp(data_MAGIC)$x)
ggplot(data_MAGIC_PCA) +
  geom_point(aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = data_MAGIC$result$VIM)) +
  scale_color_viridis(option = "B") +
  labs(color = "VIM")
```


### Visualizing MAGIC values on PHATE

We can visualize the results of MAGIC on PHATE as follows. We set `t` and `k` manually, because this toy dataset is really too small to make sense with PHATE; however, the default values work well for single-cell genomic data.

```{r run_phate}
data_PHATE <- phate(magic_testdata, k = 3, t = 15)
ggplot(data_PHATE) +
  geom_point(aes(x = PHATE1, y = PHATE2, color = data_MAGIC$result$VIM)) +
  scale_color_viridis(option = "B") +
  labs(color = "VIM")
```

## Issues

### FAQ

  - **Should genes (features) by rows or columns?**

To be consistent with common functions such as PCA
(`stats::prcomp`) and t-SNE (`Rtsne::Rtsne`), we require that cells
(observations) be rows and genes (features) be columns of your input
data.

  - **I have installed MAGIC in Python, but Rmagic says it is not
    installed!**

Check your `reticulate::py_discover_config("magic")` and compare it to
the version of Python in which you installed PHATE (run `which python`
and `which pip` in a terminal.) Chances are `reticulate` canâ€™t find the
right version of Python; you can fix this by adding the following line
to your `~/.Renviron`:

`PATH=/path/to/my/python`

You can read more about `Renviron` at
<https://cran.r-project.org/package=startup/vignettes/startup-intro.html>.

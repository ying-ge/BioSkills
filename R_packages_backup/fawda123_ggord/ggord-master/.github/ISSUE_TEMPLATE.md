# Issues

Any issues or feature requests can be posted on the [issues](https://github.com/fawda123/ggord/issues) page. Please briefly describe your problem and what output you expect. If you have a question, please don't use this form. Instead, ask on <https://stackoverflow.com/> or send me a direct message.

Please include a minimal reproducible example (AKA a reprex). If you've never heard of a [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) before, start by reading <https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex>.

	abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a frequently lethal disease with heterogeneous outcomes and drug responses. To resolve inconsistencies among the reported gene expression–based CRC classifications and facilitate clinical translation, we formed an international consortium dedicated to large-scale data sharing and analytics across expert groups. We show marked interconnectivity between six independent classification systems coalescing into four consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs) with distinguishing features: CMS1 (microsatellite instability immune, 14\%), hypermutated, microsatellite unstable and strong immune activation; CMS2 (canonical, 37\%), epithelial, marked WNT and MYC signaling activation; CMS3 (metabolic, 13\%), epithelial and evident metabolic dysregulation; and CMS4 (mesenchymal, 23\%), prominent transforming growth factor–β activation, stromal invasion and angiogenesis. Samples with mixed features (13\%) possibly represent a transition phenotype or intratumoral heterogeneity. We consider the CMS groups the most robust classification system currently available for CRC—with clear biological interpretability—and the basis for future clinical stratification and subtype-based targeted interventions.},

	abstract = {Gene-expression signature-based disease classification and clinical outcome prediction has not been widely introduced in clinical medicine as initially expected, mainly due to the lack of extensive validation needed for its clinical deployment. Obstacles include variable measurement in microarray assay, inconsistent assay platform, analytical requirement for comparable pair of training and test datasets, etc. Furthermore, as medical device helping clinical decision making, the prediction needs to be made for each single patient with a measure of its reliability. To address these issues, there is a need for flexible prediction method less sensitive to difference in experimental and analytical conditions, applicable to each single patient, and providing measure of prediction confidence. The nearest template prediction (NTP) method provides a convenient way to make class prediction with assessment of prediction confidence computed in each single patient's gene-expression data using only a list of signature genes and a test dataset. We demonstrate that the method can be flexibly applied to cross-platform, cross-species, and multiclass predictions without any optimization of analysis parameters.},

Simulation studies show that voom performs as well or better than count-based RNA-seq methods even when the data are generated according to the assumptions of the earlier methods.

	abstract = {Competitive gene set tests are commonly used in molecular pathway analysis to test for enrichment of a particular gene annotation category amongst the differential expression results from a microarray experiment. Existing gene set tests that rely on gene permutation are shown here to be extremely sensitive to inter-gene correlation. Several data sets are analyzed to show that inter-gene correlation is non-ignorable even for experiments on homogeneous cell populations using genetically identical model organisms. A new gene set test procedure (CAMERA) is proposed based on the idea of estimating the inter-gene correlation from the data, and using it to adjust the gene set test statistic. An efficient procedure is developed for estimating the inter-gene correlation and characterizing its precision. CAMERA is shown to control the type I error rate correctly regardless of inter-gene correlations, yet retains excellent power for detecting genuine differential expression. Analysis of breast cancer data shows that CAMERA recovers known relationships between tumor subtypes in very convincing terms. CAMERA can be used to analyze specified sets or as a pathway analysis tool using a database of molecular signatures.},

	abstract = {limma is an R/Bioconductor software package that provides an integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},

This classification provides a potential framework for stratified treatment, but to identify novel {CMS}-drug associations, translation of the subtypes to pre-clinical models is essential. The currently available classifier is dependent on gene expression signals from the immune and stromal compartments of tumors and fails to identify the poor-prognostic {CMS}4-mesenchymal group in immortalized cell lines, patient-derived organoids and xenografts. To address this, we present a novel {CMS} classifier based on a filtered set of cancer cell-intrinsic, subtype-enriched gene expression markers. This new classifier, referred to as {CMScaller}, recapitulated the subtypes in both in vitro and in vivo models (551 in total). Importantly, by analyzing public drug response data from patient-derived xenografts and cell lines, we show that the subtypes are predictive of response to standard {CRC} drugs. {CMScaller} is available as an R package.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Response to standard oncologic treatment is limited in colorectal cancer. The gene expression–based consensus molecular subtypes ({CMS}) provide a new paradigm for stratified treatment and drug repurposing; however, drug discovery is currently limited by the lack of translation of {CMS} to preclinical models.
Experimental Design: We analyzed {CMS} in primary colorectal cancers, cell lines, and patient-derived xenografts ({PDX}). For classification of preclinical models, we developed an optimized classifier enriched for cancer cell–intrinsic gene expression signals, and performed high-throughput in vitro drug screening (n = 459 drugs) to analyze subtype-specific drug sensitivities.
Results: The distinct molecular and clinicopathologic characteristics of each {CMS} group were validated in a single-hospital series of 409 primary colorectal cancers. The new, cancer cell–adapted classifier was found to perform well in primary tumors, and applied to a panel of 148 cell lines and 32 {PDXs}, these colorectal cancer models were shown to recapitulate the biology of the {CMS} groups. Drug screening of 33 cell lines demonstrated subtype-dependent response profiles, confirming strong response to {EGFR} and {HER}2 inhibitors in the {CMS}2 epithelial/canonical group, and revealing strong sensitivity to {HSP}90 inhibitors in cells with the {CMS}1 microsatellite instability/immune and {CMS}4 mesenchymal phenotypes. This association was validated in vitro in additional {CMS}-predicted cell lines. Combination treatment with 5-fluorouracil and luminespib showed potential to alleviate chemoresistance in a {CMS}4 {PDX} model, an effect not seen in a chemosensitive {CMS}2 {PDX} model.
Conclusions: We provide translation of {CMS} classification to preclinical models and uncover a potential for targeted treatment repurposing in the chemoresistant {CMS}4 group. Clin Cancer Res; 24(4); 794–806. ©2017 {AACR}.},

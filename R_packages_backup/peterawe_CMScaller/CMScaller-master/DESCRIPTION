Title: CMScaller: an R package for consensus molecular subtyping of colorectal cancer pre-clinical models
Description: Colorectal cancers (CRCs) can be divided into four gene expression-based and biologically distinct consensus molecular subtypes (CMS). This classification is clinically relevant and provides both prognostic stratification of the patients and a potential basis for stratified treatment. CMScaller provides CMS classification of pre-clinical models such as cell lines, organoids and patient derived xenografts based on a microarray or RNA-sequencing gene expression data.

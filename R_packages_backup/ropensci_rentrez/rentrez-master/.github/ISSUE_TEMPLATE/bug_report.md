Sometimes `rentrez` will throw obscure error messages because the NCBI's webservers are down or otherwise not behaving as they are meant to. Before reporting issues about errors thrown while contacting an NCBI database (search, fetch, summary,	 link...) you can test the NCBI is responding to requests by pasting the following URLS into a web browser.	

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=snp&id=6060535&retmote=rsr	
https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/esearch.fcgi?db=pubmed&term=rentrez	

They should give you a plain text file and a small XML file respectively. If you receive errors when trying to aces the URLs it is likely they the NCBI is	having an intermittent problem, try your request again in a few minutes. If those pages load as expected then please file your issue. We appreciate user	
feedback and will do our best to help.
